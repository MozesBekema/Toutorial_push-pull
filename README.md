# How to push and pull an existing project via git bash
<br/>
<b>Before you push</b><br/>
Before you push a file you want to commit it first. You can do this by typing
<br/>
```html
git commit -m "[message here]"
```
Note: you need to add a message everytime you commit your files, otherwise it will give you a error.
<br/>
After committing you type the following:
```html
git commit -m "[message here]"
```
